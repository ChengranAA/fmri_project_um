Features of demo:

-20 random repetitions of four conditions
-2 oddball trials
-Times were adjusted the following: Prompt(1,5secs) + Jitter (differs randomly between 1.5,3, 4.5seconds) + Stimulus Period (6secs) + Rest (15secs)
- One repetiton has an overall average of 25.5 
- 20 repetitons * 27seconds = 540Seconds. This leaves only time for 1, maximum of 2 oddball trials with a total runtime of 600secs
- Proceeding of Experiment depends on 5 key input
