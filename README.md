# fMRI Experiment Programming Project
## Notes

Folders named **Resources** and **Data** will be ignored by the git program. This way some unecessary resources will be run locally to limit the space took up in git repository.


## To-do list

- [ ] some thing needs to be added
- [ ] ...
- [ ] might be useful if we have a mock scanner program that sends keystroke "5" every 1.5s

## How to setup the environment

Download the latest version of the Psychopy from their github release page. https://github.com/psychopy/psychopy/releases. The version we use in this study is PsychoPy 2022.2.4.

The program is a standalone app which don't need any other packages. It contains some necessary libaries which come in handy. The main program opens with three windows. The one we need is the **Runner** window.
